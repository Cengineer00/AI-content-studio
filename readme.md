# AI Content Studio

A collection of open-source tools for creative content generation, including **text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video, image upscaling,** and **stable scrolling**.

## 🚀 Features

- **ShortsFusion**: Automate the creation of YouTube Shorts by merging and trimming two videos into a vertical split-screen.
